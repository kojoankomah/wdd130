                        Founded in 1995 by a group of passionate outdoor enthusiasts, Blue Lagoon began as a small family-run operation in the heart of the Rockies. What started as a single raft and a handful of guided tours quickly grew as word spread about our thrilling experiences and commitment to safety. Over the years, we've expanded our offerings to include diverse river routes and adventure packages, attracting both seasoned rafters and newcomers alike. Today, we pride ourselves on being a leader in the rafting community, dedicated to preserving the rivers we love and inspiring future generations to explore the great outdoors.
